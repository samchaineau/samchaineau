## My background 👨🏼‍💻
 I am a french economist, turned into a data scientist turning into a Deep Learning practicioner, specifically in sequence analysis (text, time series, trajectories...). I am a creative and curious person with a strong desire to exchange, collaborate and build impactful products.

## My projects 📒
### [NLP for Economics](https://huggingface.co/collections/samchain) 📈

- Built a dataset of speeches from various central banks scrapped on the BIS website

### [Fast LLM inference with token merging](https://github.com/samchaineau/llm_slerp_generation) 🤙
- Proposed a framework to speed up LLM inference using token merging
- Using SLERP at a given layer indice in order to reduce the sequence length by a factor up to 2
- Tested on Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 with strongly encouraging results

## My background 👨🏼‍💻
 I am a french data scientist specialised in Deep-Learning, and more specifically in sequence analysis (text, time series, trajectories...). I am a creative and curious person with a strong desire to exchange, collaborate and build imapctful solutions.

## My projects 📒
### Fast LLM inference with token merging 🤙
- Proposed a framework to speed up LLM inference using token merging
- Using SLERP at a given layer indice in order to reduce the sequenc elength by a factor up to 2
- Tested on Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 with strongly encouraging results

### QB-GPT : A GPT for football plays 🏈
- Trained a Decoder-only model on prediciting NFL teams trajectories at a 0.3 second frame rate
- Able to generate various plays which can be used to forecast and/or simulate plays outcomes

### StratFormer : A BERT for football plays 🏈
- Designed BERT-like model on NFL player trajectories to scout NFL playbooks
- Strong results and possibility to summarize thousands of plays in a dozen of minutes

### NuvoChat 🏥
- Built a medical database using web-scraping on the MSD Manual
- FIne-tuned a Mistral 7B v0.2 Instruct model on it, showcasing high relevancy in medical assistance settings

### EconoBert and Econo-Sentence 📈
- Created EconoBert and econosentence, two encoder models specific to the domain of economics

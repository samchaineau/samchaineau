## My background 👨🏼‍💻
 I am a french data scientist specialised in Deep-Learning, and more specifically in sequence analysis (text, time series, trajectories...). I am a creative and curious person with a strong desire to exchange, collaborate and build impactful products.

## My projects 📒
### [Fast LLM inference with token merging](https://github.com/samchaineau/llm_slerp_generation) 🤙
- Proposed a framework to speed up LLM inference using token merging
- Using SLERP at a given layer indice in order to reduce the sequence length by a factor up to 2
- Tested on Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 with strongly encouraging results

### [QB-GPT : A GPT for football plays](https://github.com/samchaineau/QB-GPT) 🏈
- Trained a Decoder-only model on predicting NFL teams trajectories at a 0.3 second frame rate
- Able to generate various plays which can be used to forecast and/or simulate plays outcomes

### [StratFormer : A BERT for football plays](https://github.com/samchaineau/StratFormer) 🏈
- Designed a BERT-like model on NFL player trajectories to scout NFL playbooks
- Strong results and possibility to summarize thousands of plays in a dozen of minutes

### [NuvoChat](https://huggingface.co/collections/nuvocare/nuvochat-65eeb989a735404e87ba733e) 🏥
- Built a medical database using web-scraping on the MSD Manual
- Fine-tuned a Mistral 7B v0.2 Instruct model on it, showcasing high relevancy in medical assistance settings

### [EconoBert and Econo-Sentence](https://huggingface.co/collections/samchain/nlp-for-economics-6620f064bfe7fdb2c5e12459) 📈
- Created EconoBert, a Bert designed for applications in the domain of economics
- Created EconoSentence, a sentence-transformers designed to produce document embeddings for applications in economics
- Built a dataset of speeches from various central banks scrapped on the BIS website
